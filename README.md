# README Generator

## Description

The README generator allows users to quickly create a professional README for a new project. It takes input from the user regarding the details of their project and then produces a README.md file which can be included with the project.

## Installtion

Users will require NodeJS in order to run the application. Please visit the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) site to download and install NodeJS. Users will also need to download or clone the files from this GitHub repo and place them on their local machine.

Once the README generator files have been downloaded or cloned, ensure that the files have been unzipped (if they were downloaded in a zip file), and placed somewhere conveniently accessible. Then, using the command-line interface of your choice, browse to the file location.

Use the command `npm init` to install the required dependencies.

## Usage

Once the dependencies have installed, use the command `node index` to run the program. The user is prompted to answer questions and provide information about their project. This information will be used to create the README file.
